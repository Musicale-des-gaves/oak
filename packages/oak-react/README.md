<h3>oak-react</h3>
<p>A simple wrapper to use Oak inside React</p>

</div>

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @poool/oak @poool/oak-react
```

## Usage

With this React SDK you can add the Oak renderer easily in your projects, simply using our Builder component.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Builder } from '@poool/oak-react';

export default () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState([]);

  const onChange = field => {
    setValue(field.value);
  };

  return (
    <Builder
      onChange={onChange}
      value={value}
    />
  );
};
```

This will simply render a new Oak builder, with an empty content inside and with a `onChange` event listener which simply logs the new value of the Oak builder. This seems to be the most basic usage of the Oak SDK.

Note that you are mandatory to pass an array as the value of the builder. Pass an empty array if you want to start with an empty builder.
